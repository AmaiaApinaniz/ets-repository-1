Dear user,
we have recently created [a new GitHub space](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community) to be used as the unique place to interact with the community of the INSPIRE Reference Validator. Please [open a ticket in this new space](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues/new/choose) to report a problem or bug of the Validator, to propose an improvement to the Validator, and to start a discussion about the Validator. This new space will be the only one to be kept monitored in the future.
