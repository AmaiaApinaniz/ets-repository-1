= Testing Annex I data sets

There are 7 categories for the Annex I themes:

* Addresses
* Administrative Unit
* Cadastral Parcels
* Geographical Names
* Hydrography
* Protected Sites
* Transport Networks

Additionally, there is one _Interoperable data sets in GML_ category which
contains test suites for conformance classes specific to interoperable data
sets encoded in GML, for any INSPIRE data theme. All Annex I test suites invoke
automatically the test suites in this category.

To check an INSPIRE data set in GML for full compliance, select all Test Suites
in the appropriate category. For example for a data set containing Addresses
scroll to the *Data Theme: Addresses (Data Specification version 3.1)*
category and select all 4 Conformance Classes:

* Application schema, Addresses
* Data consistency, Addresses
* Information accessibility, Addresses
* Reference systems, Addresses

by using the 'use' flip switch on the right-hand side of the Test Suites.

Afterwards click on the *Start* button.

The files can either be uploaded or used by the INSPIRE validator by providing an URL.

NOTE: The Validator only accepts files with XML and GML file ending and ZIP
files containing these two file types. All other files like schema files can
not be used and are silently ignored by the Validator!

== File upload
If the files are locally stored on your system use the
_Data source_ selector in the _Configure Test Run_ dialog and select
*File Upload*.

After clicking on *Choose files* one or multiple files can be selected.
Afterwards the button is locked. When the upload finishes, the *Start*
button can be clicked to start the test.

Further steps are described in the
link:http://docs.etf-validator.net/User_manuals/Simplified_workflows.html#_test_run_configuration[standard manual].

== Reference remote files by URL
If the data are available on the web they can be tested by entering one single URL.
Use the _Data source_ selector and select *Remote file (URL)* in the _Configure Test Run_ dialog.

Enter the URL to either one XML, GML or ZIP file -or rather the URL of your
service that returns one of these types.
If the URL requires authentication, username and password can be provided by clicking on __Credentials__. Afterwards the Test can be started by clicking on *Start*
