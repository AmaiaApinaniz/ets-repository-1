The files can either be uploaded or used remotely by the INSPIRE validator by providing an URL.

NOTE: The Validator only accepts files with XML and GML file ending and ZIP files containing these two file types.
All other files like schema files can not be used and are silently ignored by the Validator.

== File upload
If the files are locally stored on your system use the _Data source_ selector
in the _Configure Test Run_ dialog and select *File Upload*.

After clicking on *Choose files* one or multiple files can be selected.
Afterwards the button is locked. When the upload finishes, the *Start*
button can be clicked to start the test.

== Reference remote files by URL
If the data are available on the web they can be tested by entering one single URL.
Use the _Data source_ selector and select *Remote file (URL)* in the _Configure Test Run_ dialog.

Enter the URL to either one XML, GML or ZIP file -or rather the URL of your
service that returns one of these types.
